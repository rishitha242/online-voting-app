        The Election Commission of India is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for 
        administering election processes in India. The body administers elections to the Lok Sabha,
        Rajya Sabha, state Legislative Assemblies, state legislative Councils, and the offices of 
        the President and Vice President of the country.[2][3] The Election Commission operates 
        under the authority of Constitution per Article 324,[4] and subsequently enacted Representation 
        of the People Act.[5] The commission has the powers under the Constitution, to act in an 
        appropriate manner when the enacted laws make insufficient provisions to deal with a given
        situation in the conduct of an election. Being a constitutional authority, Election Commission
        is amongst the few institutions which function with both autonomy and freedom, along with the
        countryâ€™s higher judiciary, the Union Public Service Commission and the Comptroller and 
        Auditor General of India.
